Target Godot Version

This project was created targeting Godot 4.5.1.

Notes:
- Scene format and GDScript use Godot 4 APIs.
- If you open with a different Godot 4.x patch (e.g., 4.4 or 4.6), the project will most likely still work; minor API changes are rare across small patch versions.
- For Godot 3.5 compatibility, many APIs and scene formats differ; request a compatibility pass if needed.
