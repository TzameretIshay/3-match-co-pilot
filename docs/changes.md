# Change log — Match-3 starter

This file lists recent changes made while preparing the project.

- Implemented basic project structure (scenes, scripts, assets folder).
- Implemented core match-3 gameplay: grid generation, swap, match detection, clear, gravity and refill.
- Added UI with score and moves labels and a restart button.
- Implemented tween-based swap animations for better UX.
- Fixed bugs in initial implementation: duplicate parenting, null checks in match detection, reset logic, and scoring count.

Planned next improvements:
- Add falling (gravity) animations for tiles when refilling.
- Add sounds and particle VFX for tile pop and combos.
- Implement power-ups (line-clear, bomb) for matches of length 4/5.
- Add level progression, objectives and more polished UI.
