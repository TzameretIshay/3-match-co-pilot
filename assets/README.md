Assets placeholder

This folder should contain tile images and sound effects that the game references.

Expected files (place your own art/sfx here):
- `tile_0.png` ... `tile_5.png` (64x64 PNGs recommended)
- `swap.wav` (small click/slide)
- `pop.wav` (short pop sound)
- `match_chain.wav` (pleasant rising tone for combos)

If these files are present, the `Grid` manager will automatically assign `tile_X.png` textures to tile instances.
